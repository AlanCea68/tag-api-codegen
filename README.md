# üè∑Ô∏è The T.A.G. API Code Generator üè∑Ô∏è

Otherwise known as the **T**ypescript **A**PI **G**enerator!
This project aims to provide a simple single purpose generation for typescript api code and directories for front end projects. Currently using openApi 3 specification.

This package is agnostic to request libraries a developer might use, but remains opinionated about file structure and organization.

## Usage

`npx taggem [-m] [--monolith] [path/to/input.y(a)ml] [path/to/output/]`
Is the explicit version of the implicit call. This runs the generator in "monolith" mode.
This splits your api into multiple directories based on the open api `tag` assingments and
treasts each tag as a servlet. It may not save your api, but it will save your eyes.

`npx taggem [-s] [--service] [path/to/input.y(a)ml] [path/to/output/]`
This runs the generator in "microservice mode" where your generated api code will be placed into a single directory of the same name as the api `title`. This ignores `tags` for further organization.

## Results

-   One or more directories (depending on how the generator was invoked) containing the a file with typescript functions that will return a configuration object detailing how to access an api resource. E.g. (assuming -\-m),
-   `exampleTagName/index.ts` - the file containing api request configuration information.
-   `exampleTagNameModelTypes.ts` - The exported typescript interfaces of open api `schema`.
-   `exampleTagNameModels.ts` - The exported runtime representation of open api `schema`.

NOTE: The code generator will **always** create another directory called `api` to store the results so be wary when wanting to set your output directory to a similar name.
